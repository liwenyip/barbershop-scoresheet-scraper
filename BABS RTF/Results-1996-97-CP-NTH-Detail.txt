OFFICIAL CONTEST RESULT
NORTHERN CHORUS PRELIMS  -  SOUTHPORT: 1996/97
Scores from semi-finals are normalised to take account of any panel size differences. Decimal fractions may therefore exist.
Category rankings are calculated on the category totals including previous scores where these exist.
Category scores reflect any score reductions. Reductions are shown in brackets under column headers MR, PR and SR.
